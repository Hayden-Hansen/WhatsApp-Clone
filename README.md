# WhatsApp-Clone

This WhatsApp Clone is an excellent front end project to make, and it utilizes MongoDB to store messages and Pusher to display messages in real time!

I began making this app as I saw the tutorial on Youtube! Here is the link to that video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzdQDxzW2Tw&t=10936s

Clever Programmer is one of the best coding channels on Youtube and their tutorial is very easy to follow! However, there is a slight problem:

Towards the end of the video (around the 3 hour mark), Sonny, the instructor, says that he will not finish the clone and asks us to refer to his previous whatsapp clone (the video where he used firebase rather than mongoDB to store messages, link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUxrDcITyjg) in order to complete the rest of the app. This is the complete version of that app!

I finished the app, which includes:
  - storing messages in MongoDB
  - Being able to store, add, and retrieve chat rooms in MongoDB
  - Search filter by chat rooms in MongoDB
  - Few other minor updates
  
  
 This is an excellent clone app that will get you familiar with MongoDB and Pusher. Enjoy!
